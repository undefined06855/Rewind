"It's Rewind time." - Will Smith, 2018


remember to fill this out

todo:
- mod icon
- ios
- settings
- performance checks
- stuff on ui layer (stuff set with ui trigger) not being drawn to frame preview rendertexture
- camera rotation not taken into account
- timeline to show how many frames are left
- toggle mode instead of hold by default
todo later:
- shaders not being drawn to rendertexture
- maybe move rendertexture "fix" to a separate mod for other mods to depend on?
