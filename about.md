"It's Rewind time." - Will Smith, 2018

This mod adds a rewind button in practice that allows you to go back in time and continue the level from a previous moment, without having to spam checkpoints! Open any level in practice mode and hold C (custoimisable in Custom Keybind settings) to rewind back to up to a configurable amount, similar to the rewind feature in Mario Kart World! (smh Nintendo is stealing my mod ideas to use in their games)

If you experience crashes, slowdowns or any performance issues using the mod (especially so on integrated GPUs and lower end devices), use the settings in the bottom left to customise options such as the amount of frames stored, frequency of capture and resolution of capture.
