"It's Rewind time." - Will Smith, 2018

This mod adds a rewind button in practice that allows you to go back in time and continue the level from a previous moment, without having to spam checkpoints! Open any level in practice mode and hold C (can be change din mod settings)

The mod also has mobile support, with snazzy ui which integrates into GD's existing checkpoint system, and customisable keybinds for Windows and Mac users. iOS support will come eventually!
